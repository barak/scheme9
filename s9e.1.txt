NAME
          s9e - Extended Scheme Interpreter

USAGE
          s9e [-h?] [-giqv] [-d image] [-f program] [-m size[m]]
              [-- argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
          Scheme  9  from  Empty  Space  is an interpreter for a broad
          subset of R4RS Scheme. The s9e command starts  the  extended
          interpreter. The extended interpreter defines some functions
          that are not defined in the Scheme Reports,  but  may  prove
          useful in ``real-world'' programming.

EXTENDED FUNCTIONS
          Functions  returning  an  unspecific  value  typically abort
          evaluation when an error occurs.

          (unix:chdir string) ==> unspecific
              Change the current working directory to string.
          (unix:chmod string integer) ==> unspecific
              Change the access bits of the file string  to  the  mode
              integer.
          (unix:chown string integer1 integer2) ==> unspecific
              Change  the  ownership  for  the  file string to user ID
              integer1 and the group ID integer2.
          (unix:command-line) ==> list of string
              Return the command line arguments passed  to  s9e  after
              the "--" argument.
          (unix:exit integer) ==> undefined
              Terminate  the s9e process and return integer as an exit
              code to the calling process.
          (unix:flush output-port) ==> unspecific
              Flush the given output port.
          (unix:getcwd) ==> string
              Return the current working directory.
          (unix:getenv string) ==> string
              Return the value of the environment variable string.  If
              the variable is undefined, return #f.
          (unix:getgid) ==> integer
              Return the group ID of the s9e process.
          (unix:getpwnam string) ==> alist
              Return  the  password  record  for the user name string.
              The returned association list has the following members:
              ((user  . string)   ; user name
               (uid   . integer)  ; user ID
               (gid   . integer)  ; group ID
               (gecos . string)   ; real name
               (home  . string)   ; home directory
               (shell . string))  ; default shell
          (unix:getpwuid integer) ==> alist
              Return the password record for the user ID integer.  See
              unix:getpwnam for the structure of the return value.
          (unix:getuid) ==> integer
              Return the user ID of the s9e process.

          (unix:link string1 string2) ==> unspecific
              Create a (hard) link string2 that  refers  to  the  same
              file as string1.
          (unix:lock string) ==> boolean
              Create  a  lock file named ``string.lock''.  If the file
              already exists when the function is called,  return  #f,
              else  return  #t.   Unix:lock uses mkdir() to create the
              lock file, which is atomic on virtually all systems.
          (unix:mkdir string integer) ==> unspecific
              Create directory string with mode integer.
          (unix:rmdir string) ==> unspecific
              Remove directory string.
          (unix:spawn string) ==> (input-port output-port)
              Spawn an inferior process running  the  command  string.
              Return  a  list  of two file descriptors where the first
              one can be used to read the output of  the  command  and
              the second one to send input to the command. The command
              will be executed using
              execl("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", "-c", string, NULL);
          (unix:stat string) ==> alist
              Return the file status of the file string.  The returned
              association list has the following members:
              ((name  . string)    ; file name
               (size  . integer)   ; size in bytes
               (uid   . integer)   ; UID of owner
               (gid   . integer)   ; GID of owner
               (mode  . integer)   ; access bits
               (ctime . integer)   ; creation time
               (atime . integer)   ; access time
               (mtime . integer)   ; modification time
               (dev   . integer)   ; device ID of containing device
               (ino   . integer)   ; inode number
               (nlink . integer))  ; number of (hard) links
          (unix:symlink string1 string2) ==> unspecific
              Create  a  symbolic link string2 that points to the path
              string1.
          (unix:system string) ==> boolean
              Run the command string and return its  exit  status  (#t
              for success and #f for failure).
          (unix:unlock string) ==> unspecific
              Remove  the  file ``string.lock''. If the files does not
              exist, do nothing.
          (unix:utimes string) ==> unspecific
              Set the access and modification time of the file  string
              to the current time.
