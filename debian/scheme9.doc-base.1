Title: S9 Core---A Toolkit for Implementing Dynamic Languages
Author: Nils M Holm
Abstract: The s9core library offers facilities required by dynamic
 languages.  Dynamic languages typically require some basic
 infrastructure that is common in their implementations, including
 garbage collection, primitive functions, and dynamic type checking,
 but sometimes also features like bignum arithmetic and heap images.
 S9core offers all of the above, and some more, in a single object
 file that can be linked against a dynamic language implementation.
 It takes care of all the nitty gritty stuff and allows the
 implementor to focus on the design of the language itself.
