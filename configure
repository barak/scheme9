To compile a bare-bones S9fES system in a Unix user land, run:

	cc -Dunix -o s9 s9.c
	./s9 -i - -d s9.image

To compile the S9fES system on a native (386-based) Plan 9 system:

	8c -Dplan9 -o s9 s9.c
	./s9 -i - -d s9.image

To include portable, decimal-based real number arithmetics:

	cc -Dunix -DREALNUM -o s9 s9.c
	./s9 -i - -l s9-real.scm -d s9.image

To compile all extensions, try "make all". This should work fine on
FreeBSD, *BSD, and Linux. Refer to the README and Makefile for further
instructions.

Good Luck!  I hope you'll enjoy using Scheme 9 from Empty Space!
