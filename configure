Cowardice asks the question, "Is it safe?" Expediency asks the
question, "It it politic?"   Vanity asks the question,  "Is it
popular?"   But, conscience asks the question,  "Is it right?"
And there comes a time  when one must take a position  that is
neither safe nor politic,  not popular,  but one must take it,
because one's conscienceness tells one that it is right.
