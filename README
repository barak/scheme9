	Scheme 9 from Empty Space
	A Portable Scheme Interpreter with a Unix Interface
	By Nils M Holm, 2007-2010

	S9fES is a mature, portable, and comprehensible public-domain
	interpreter for R4RS Scheme offering

	- support for low-level Unix programming;
	- cursor addressing with Curses;
	- decimal-based real number arithmetics;
	- a vi-style integrated development environment (beta!);
	- basic networking procedures;
	- loads of useful library functions.

	It is written in ANSI C (C89) and Scheme and it runs in many
	popular environments, including *BSD, Linux, Plan 9, and the
	unmentionable horror (although the Plan 9 and Horror versions
	probably exclude most of the above goodies).

	The S9fES code strives to be simple and comprehensible. It is
	particularly interesting to people who want to (a) write Unix
	programs in a high-level language (b) try Scheme without having
	to jump through too many hoops (c) study the implementation of
	Scheme (in a language other than Scheme). 

	ARSE, the S9fES IDE, is completely written in Scheme with most
	of the S9fES-specific procedures factored out cleanly.


	QUICK START

	You can run the interpreter in its build directory without
	installing it. Just type "cc -Dunix -o s9 s9.c" and then "./s9".

	The S9 code is only loosely coupled to its Makefile, so in most
	cases running "cc -Dunix -o s9 s9.c" or "8c -Dplan9 -o s9 s9.c"
	will compile the interpreter just fine. (However, doing so will
	not include the Unix/Curses/Networking extensions.)

	On most systems of the Unix family (plus CygWin and MINGW),
	you can compile and install S9fES by running "make install".

	Once installed, typing "s9" will start the interpreter.

	(help) explains the online help system.
	(apropos) returns a list of all help topics (long!).


	COMPILING AND INSTALLING

	Unix

	To compile S9fES, run "make test" (this will also run the test
	suite to make sure that the interpreter works properly). Running
	"make tests" will run even more tests.

	On 64-bit systems, you may want to add the -DBITS_PER_WORD_64
	define to the Makefile. Not doing so will probably still work,
	but result in slightly worse bignum performance.

	You can install S9fES (including the goodies) on a Unix system
	by typing "make install" as root, but before doing so, please
	edit at least the PREFIX variable at the beginning of Makefile.
	(Make sure to re-compile S9fES (make clean; make) after changing
	 PREFIX, because it is used to set up some internal paths).

	Plan 9

	To compile S9fES on Plan 9 from Bell Labs, just type "mk", but
	note that the Plan 9 port is rather experimental at this stage.
	Above all, there is currently no installation procedure.

	Manual Installation

	To install S9fES manually,

	- Compile s9 with a proper default library path (the one
	  hardwired in "s9.h" is probably not what you want). E.g.:

	  cc -o s9 -DDEFAULT_LIBRARY_PATH="\"your-path\"" s9.c

	  A reasonable value for "your-path" would be, for example:

	  ".:~/s9fes:/usr/local/share/s9fes"

	  Security fetishists may consider removing the dot.

	- Copy the "s9" binary to a location where it can be executed
	  (e.g. /usr/local/bin).

	- Copy the file "s9.scm" to a publically readable directory
	  (default: /usr/local/share/s9fes). This directory will be
	  referred to as LIBDIR in the following instructions.

	- Compile a heap image and copy it to LIBDIR:

	  s9 -d s9.image

	  The image file must have the same base name as the interpreter
	  or it will not be loaded. An image loads significantly faster
	  than source code.

	Optionally:

	- Copy the content of the "lib" directory to LIBDIR. This
	  directory contains lots of useful Scheme functions.

	- Copy the content of the "contrib" directory to LIBDIR. These
	  files contain additional Scheme functions contributed by other
	  authors or imported from various sources.

	- Create a subdirectory named "help" in LIBDIR and copy the
	  content of the "help" directory to LIBDIR/help. These files
	  are part of the interactive help system.

	- Copy the nroff(1) source code of the manual page "s9.1" to
	  section 1 of your online manual (e.g. /usr/local/man/man1).
	  In case you are not running Unix, there is a pre-formatted
	  copy in the file "s9.1.txt".


	CONFIGURATION

	You may create the S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and
	make it point to LIBDIR as well as other directories that
	contain Scheme programs. The variable may contain a single
	directory or a colon-separated list of directories that will be
	searched in sequence for image files, library files, and help
	pages (in "help" subdirectories of the given paths).

	S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH overrides DEFAULT_LIBRARY_PATH, so all
	directories listed in the latter should also be present in
	the former.

	If you set up an rc file in your home directory ($HOME/.s9fes/rc),
	this file will be LOADed before entering the REPL. It will never
	be loaded when running programs non-interactively (with the -f
	option).

	To create an image file containing additional functionality,
	add the desired options to the "config.scm" file and run

	s9 -n -l config.scm -d s9.image


	GETTING STARTED

	Typing "s9" will drop you into the read-eval-print loop of the
	interpreter. You can run Scheme programs non-interactively by
	typing "s9 -f program.scm" at your shell prompt.

	If you installed the extension library functions in LIBDIR,
	they can be loaded by the LOAD-FROM-LIBRARY procedure:

	> (load-from-library "draw-tree.scm")
	; loading from /usr/local/share/s9fes/draw-tree.scm
	> (draw-tree '(a b c))
	[o|o]---[o|o]---[o|/]
	 |       |       |
	 a       b       c
	> _

	Feel free to explore them.

	Running "s9help topic" on the shell prompt will print the S9fES
	online help page about the given topic.

	To get an overview of ARSE (if installed), just run the "arse"
	command and then enter ":h" inside of the editor. Entering
	"/SCHEME PROG" will bring you straight to the Scheme-specific
	section of the help file.


	EXTENDED INTERPRETER

	If compiled in, there are some extension procedures providing
	access to some Unix system calls, some networking procedures,
	and a Curses interface. To compile these extensions, uncomment
	the three subsequent EXTRA_ lines in the Makefile. (In fact,
	the Unix extensions are compiled by default.)
