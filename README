	Scheme 9 from Empty Space
	A Simple and Comprehensible Scheme Interpreter

	S9fES is an interpreter for a broad subset of R4RS Scheme.


	QUICK START

	You can run the interpreter in its build directory without
	installing it. Just run "make" and then "./s9".

	On most systems of the Unix family (plus CygWin and MINGW),
	you can compile and install S9fES by running "make install".

	Once installed, entering "s9" starts the interpreter.

	(load-from-library "help.scm") loads the online help system.
	(help) explains the online help system.
	(apropos) returns a list of all help topics.


	COMPILING AND INSTALLING

	Unix

	To compile S9fES, run "make test" (this will also run the test
	suite to make sure that the interpreter works properly).

	On 64-bit systems, you may want to add the -DBITS_PER_WORD_64
	define to the Makefile. Not doing so will probably still work,
	but result in slightly worse bignum performance.

	You can install S9fES (including the goodies) on a Unix system
	by typing "make install" as root, but before doing so, please
	edit at least the PREFIX variable at the beginning of Makefile.

	Plan 9

	To compile S9fES on Plan 9 from Bell Labs, just type "mk", but
	note that the Plan 9 port is rather experimental at this stage.
	Above all, there is currently no installation procedure.

	Manual Installation

	To install S9fES manually,

	- Copy the "s9" binary to a location where it can be executed
	  (e.g. /usr/local/bin)

	- Copy the file "s9.scm" to a publically readable directory
	  (default: /usr/local/share/s9fes). This directory will be
	  referred to as LIBDIR in the following instructions.

	- Compile a heap image and copy it to LIBDIR. Typing
	  "s9 -d s9.image" will compile an image. You must name the
	  image "s9.image" or S9 will not load it. An image loads
	  significantly faster than source code.

	Optionally:

	- Copy the content of the "lib" directory to LIBDIR. This
	  directory contains lots of useful Scheme functions.

	- Create a subdirectory named "contrib" in LIBDIR and copy the
	  content of the "contrib" directory to LIBDIR/contrib. These
	  files contain additional Scheme functions contributed by other
	  authors or imported from various sources.

	- Create a subdirectory named "help" in LIBDIR and copy the
	  content of the "help" directory to LIBDIR/help. These files
	  are part of the interactive help system.

	- Copy the nroff(1) source code of the manual page "s9.1" to
	  section 1 of your online manual (e.g. /usr/local/man/man1).
	  In case you are not running Unix, there is a pre-formatted
	  copy in the file "s9.1.txt".


	CONFIGURATION

	You may create the S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and
	make it point to LIBDIR as well as other directories that
	contain Scheme functions. The variable may contain a single
	directory or a colon-separated list of directories that will be
	searched in sequence for image files, library files and help
	pages (in "help" subdirectories of the given paths).

	If you set up an rc file in your home directory ($HOME/.s9fes/rc),
	this file will be loaded after the library image file but before
	running any programs. It is an ordinary Scheme source file.

	To create an image file containing additional functionality,
	use the -f command line option in combination with -d. For
	example, the following command will compile an image containing
	the online help system and the pretty-printer:

	s9 -n -f lib/help.scm -f lib/pretty-print.scm -d s9.image


	GETTING STARTED

	Typing "s9" will drop you into the read-eval-print loop of the
	interpreter. You can run Scheme programs non-interactively by
	typing "s9 -f program.scm" at your shell prompt.

	If you installed the extension library functions in LIBDIR,
	they can be loaded by the LOAD-FROM-LIBRARY procedure:

	> (load-from-library "draw-tree.scm")
	; loading from /usr/local/share/s9fes/draw-tree.scm
	> (draw-tree '(a b c))
	[o|o]---[o|o]---[o|/]
	 |       |       |
	 a       b       c
	> _

	Feel free to explore them.

	The extension library contains an online help system that can
	also be loaded with LOAD-FROM-LIBRARY. It contains descriptions
	of all R4RS procedures and all additional procedures implemented
	by S9fES:

	> (load-from-library "help.scm")
	; loading from /usr/local/share/s9fes/help.scm
	> (help)
	  ... HELP explains itself ...


	EXTENDED INTERPRETER

	There is an experimental extension containing some Unix system
	procedures. See the S9E(1) man page for details. To (attempt to)
	compile this extension, run "make all-s9e". To install the
	extended interpreter, type "make install-s9e" (as root).
