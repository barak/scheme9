STANDARD-ERROR returns an output-file for accessing the Unix
standard error file descriptor (stderr). CALL-WITH-STDERR passes
that output-file to a unary procedure, which may use it for writing
data to stderr. WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STDERR temporarily sets the current
output port) to the stderr descriptor while running the given nullary
procedure. CALL-WITH-STDERR returns the value returned by PROCEDURE^1.
