S9fES (print obj ...) ==> unspecific

Write the external representation of each given object to the port
returned by CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT. Use WRITE to write each external
representation. Display one space character between adjacent objects.
Display a newline sequence after the last object. PRINT with no
arguments is equal to NEWLINE.
