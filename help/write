R4RS 6.10.3  (write object)              ==>  unspecific
             (write object output-port)  ==>  unspecific

Writes a written representation of OBJECT to the given port. Strings
that appear in the written representation are enclosed in doublequotes,
and within those strings backslash and doublequote characters are
escaped by backslashes. WRITE returns an unspecified value. The
OUTPUT-PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to
the value returned by CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT.
