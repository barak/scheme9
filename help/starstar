S9fES ** ==> form
      *extensions* ==> list of symbols
      *library-path* ==> string
      *loading* ==> boolean

These are dynamic variables defined at the top level of S9fES.
** evaluates to the result most recently displayed at the REPL.
*EXTENSIONS* lists the extension procedures provided by the extended
interpreter (if any). *LIBRARY-PATH* is a string containing the
value of the S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as initialized
when the interpreter launches (or a reasonable default value).
*LOADING* is set to #T when the interpreter loads a file and
otherwise to #F.

(cons 1 2)  ==>  (1 . 2)
(car **)    ==>  1

*extensions*  ==>  ()

*library-path*  ==>  ".:~/.s9fes:/u/share/s9fes"

*loading*  ==>  #f

If you want to change the values of these variables temporarily at
run time, you need the FLUID-LET syntax, which is contained in the
S9fES extension library:

(let ((*library-path* "some-new-path"))
  (load-from-library "foo.scm"))               ==>  error

(fluid-let ((*library-path* "some-new-path"))
  (load-from-library "foo.scm"))               ==>  OK
