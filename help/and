R4RS 4.2.1 (and <test1> ...) ==> obj

The <test> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and the
value of the first expression that evaluates to a false value (see
section see section 6.1 Booleans) is returned. Any remaining
expressions are not evaluated. If all the expressions evaluate to
true values, the value of the last expression is returned. If there
are no expressions then #t is returned.

(and (= 2 2) (> 2 1))                  ==>  #t
(and (= 2 2) (< 2 1))                  ==>  #f
(and 1 2 'c '(f g))                    ==>  (f g)
(and)                                  ==>  #t
