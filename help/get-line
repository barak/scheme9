S9 LIB  (get-line integer1 integer2 string1 string2)  ==>  string | #f

GET-LINE edits a single line of text interactively.

INTEGER1 (y) and INTEGER2 (x) specify the coordinates of the
visual editing buffer on the screen. STRING2 is the initial
content of the buffer, and STRING2 is a prompt that will be
displayed in front of the buffer. The length of the buffer
is unlimited; its visual representation extends to the end
of the row on the screen. GET-LINE returns a new string with
the edited content or #F when editing is aborted.

GET-LINE renders the initial content and places the cursor
at the end of the buffer. Characters typed will be inserted
into the buffer at cursor position. In addition, GET-LINE
accepts the following editing commands ([^A] = [control]+[A]):

      [^A]        go to beginning of buffer.
      [^E]        go to end of buffer.
      [^B]        move back one character (also [Left]).
      [^D]        delete character under cursor.
      [^F]        move forward one character (also [Right]).
      [ESC]       end editing, return string (also [Enter]).
      [Backspace] delete character to the left.
      [^U]        delete all characters in buffer.
      [^C]        Abort editing, return #F (also [^G]).
