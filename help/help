Usage: (help "procedure-name")
       (help "keyword")
       (help 'symbol)
       (help)
       (apropos "string") ==> list
       (apropos 'string) ==> list
       (apropos) ==> list

The HELP procedure displays the synopsis of the given procedure or
keyword. When the given object is described in R4RS, its R4RS entry
is printed, otherwise a S9fES-specific summary is displayed.

The value of the *LINES-PER-PAGE* variable controls the number of
lines to be printed by HELP before issuing a prompt. You may want
to adjust the value of this variable by adding

(set! *lines-per-page* N)

to your $HOME/.s9fes/rc file, where N is an integer. When N=0, help
pages are written without prompting.

The APROPOS procedure returns a list of all procedure names and
keywords that contain the substring STRING for which a help page
exists, e.g.:

(apropos 'length)  ==>  (length string-length vector-length)

The help files contain modified copies of the chapters 4, 5, 6, and
the Appendix of the
