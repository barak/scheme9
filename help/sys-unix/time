S9 LIB  (time* expression)  ==>  object
        (time  form)        ==>  object

The TIME* procedures evaluates EXPRESSION, measuring the number
of allocations, reductions, etc with the STATS procedure. It also
measures the time spent reducing FORM. When finished, it prints
some interesting data and returns the normal form of FORM.
The FORM must be quoted or it will be reduced *before* running
TIME.

The TIME special form is like TIME*, but does not require its
argument to be quoted.
