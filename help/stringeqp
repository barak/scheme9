R4RS 6.7 (string=? string1 string2) ==> boolean
         (string-ci=? string1 string2) ==> boolean

Returns #t if the two strings are the same length and contain the
same characters in the same positions, otherwise returns #f.
STRING-CI=? treats upper and lower case letters as though they were
the same character, but STRING=? treats upper and lower case as
distinct characters.
