R4RS 4.2.1 (or <test1> ...) ==> obj

The <test> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and the
value of the first expression that evaluates to a true value (see
section see section 6.1 Booleans) is returned. Any remaining
expressions are not evaluated. If all expressions evaluate to false
values, the value of the last expression is returned. If there are
no expressions then #f is returned.
