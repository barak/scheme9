S9fES (wrong string) ==> undefined
      (wrong string obj) ==> undefined

Display the message in STRING. If OBJ is present, display a colon,
a space character, and the external representation of OBJ after the
message. After printing the message, abort evaluation. No result is
returned.

Rationale: WRONG is used by Scheme programs to signal errors.
