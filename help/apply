R4RS 6.8 (apply proc args) ==> obj
         (apply proc arg1 ... args) ==> obj

PROC must be a procedure and ARGS must be a list. The first form
calls PROC with the elements of ARGS as the actual arguments. The
second form is a generalization of the first that calls PROC with
the elements of the list (append (list arg1 ...) args) as the actual
arguments.

(apply + (list 3 4))                   ==>  7

(define (compose f g)
  (lambda args (f (apply g args)))))
((compose - *) 5 7)                    ==>  -35
