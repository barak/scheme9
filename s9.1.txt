S9(1)                  Scheme 9 from Empty Space                 S9(1)



NAME
          s9 - Scheme Interpreter

USAGE
          s9 [-qv] [-f program]

DESCRIPTION
          Scheme  9  from  Empty  Space  is an interpreter for a broad
          subset  of  R5RS  Scheme.  The   s9   command   starts   the
          interpreter.

OPTIONS
          -f program
              Run program and exit (implies -q).
          -q
              Be quiet: skip banners and prompts, exit on errors.
          -v
              Display version and exit.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
          S9fES  is  a tree-walking interpreter using deep binding and
          hashed environments. It employs a  constant-space  mark  and
          sweep  garbage collector with in-situ string and vector pool
          compaction. Memory pools grow on demand.
          The interpreter uses bignum integer arithmetics exclusively.

ADDITIONS
          The  symbol  **  is  always  bound to the normal form of the
          expression most recently evaluated at the top level.

          These S9 procedures are not in R5RS:

          (expand-quasiquote form) => expanded-form
              If form is a quasiquoted expression, re-write it  to  an
              equivalent  expression that does not use quasiquotation.
          (expand-syntax form) => expanded-form
              If  form  applies  a  syntax  transformer,  return   the
              expanded form, else return the form.
          (fold-left proc base list ...) => folded-list
              Combine  the  elements of the lists using proc.  Combine
              elements  left-associatively.   Base  is  the   leftmost
              element.
          (fold-right proc base list ...) => folded-list
              Combine  the  elements of the lists using proc.  Combine
              elements right-associatively.   Base  is  the  rightmost
              element.
          (map-car proc list) => mapped-list
              This is equal to map with a single list.
          (set-input-port! input-port) => unspecific
              Destructively set the current input port.
          (set-output-port! output-port) => unspecific
              Destructively set the current output port.
          (syntax->list form) => list | #f
              If  the  head  of  form  is the name of a syntax object,
              return its syntax rules, else return #f.

          (wrong string form) => bottom
              Print an error message of the form error:  string:  form
              and  terminate program execuation.  Form may be omitted.

          Redefinition of these procedures is safe except for  expand-
          quasiquote, expand-syntax, and wrong.

LIMITATIONS
          These parts of R5RS are not implemented:

          Continuations: call-with-current-continuation.
          Named let.
          The => syntax of cond.
          Local syntax: let-syntax, letrec-syntax.
          Multiple values: values, call-with-values.
          Control: do, dynamic-wind, eval.
          I/O: char-ready?.
          Transcripts: transcript-off, transcript-on.
          Numeric base prefixes: #b, #o, #x.
          Numeric tower: rational, float, complex numbers.
          Numeric syntax and procedures: #e, #i, /, acos, angle, asin,
          atan, ceiling, complex?, cos,  denominator,  exact->inexact,
          exact?,  exp,  floor,  imag-part,  inexact->exact, inexact?,
          log,  magnitude,  make-polar,  make-rectangular,  numerator,
          rational,  rationalize,  real-part,  real?, round, sin, tan,
          truncate.

BUGS
          Quasiquotation of improper lists does not work.
          Only one ellipsis per rule is allowed in syntax-rules.

FILES
          PREFIX/share/s9fes/s9.scm
              The library part of the interpreter (source code).
          $HOME/.s9fes/rc
              If present, this file is  loaded  when  the  interpreter
              starts.
          *.scm
              Scheme source code.

ENVIRONMENT
          S9FES_LIBRARY_PATH
              A  colon-separated  list  of  directories  which will be
              searched for the s9  library  when  the  interpreter  is
              launched.
              Default: .:~/.s9fes:/usr/local/share/s9fes

SIGNALS
          These  work  only  if  POSIX  signal handling was enabled at
          compile time.

          SIGINT
              Abort input or terminate program execution.
          SIGQUIT
              Terminate the interpreter process (emergency exit).
